# Protocol: UNMASK

A multiplayer social deduction party game built with React and Socket.io, designed for hackathons with 100+ concurrent players.

## Overview

Protocol: UNMASK is a real-time multiplayer party game where players create identities, form teams, and complete heist objectives together. The game uses WebSocket connections for real-time communication between players and a game master (Central Command) view.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Socket.io-client
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express 5, Socket.io (optimized for 100+ connections)
- **State Management**: Zustand

## Running the Application

Two workflows run concurrently:
1. **Backend Server**: `cd server && npm run dev` (port 3001)
2. **Frontend**: `cd client && npm run dev` (port 5000, exposed to users)

The frontend proxies Socket.io requests to the backend server.

## Game Phases

1. **Start**: Intro screen with Protocol: UNMASK branding
2. **Tutorial**: Optional YouTube briefing video for newcomers
3. **Lobby**: Players join and register identities (QR code + drawing + tell)
4. **Chain**: Players find their assigned targets using drawings and descriptions
5. **Heist**: Team minigames (Signal Jammer, Tumbler Lock)
6. **Getaway**: Final escape phase
7. **Complete**: Game results
